# Minecraft Server Plugin

This plugin handles permission for a Minecraft server.
A simple way to manage player permissions for your server without all the bloat.

This is a project I made to get better with Java and get a simple plugin for my own papermc server 🤓 

### Features:

### ⚙️ **Commands:**
- /mccontrol <permission> grant|revoke <player> <permission>
- /mccontrol getmemory
- /mcontrol modify <permission> grant|revoke playerUuid


### 🚀 Roadmap:

## commands
- add more commands like reload, reset, etc for easier management
- dry up code

## 🌟 Other ideas (nice to have):
- pre-add player permissions -> user paste one-time token to add permissions to themselves
